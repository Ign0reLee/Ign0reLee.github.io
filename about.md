Hi, My Name is LeeJeYoung, and Now the masters course at Catholic University of Korea.

I currently belong to the Computer Vision and Machine Intelligence laboratory of Catholic University.

And I have been active since July as Nvidia TA.

This Blog is just for studying and recording.

But I don't record all my studies.

I'm not going to post it regularly, and I'm going to post it as I think of it.

For more information, please contact GitHub, Facebook, or email.

Thx for reading
